# Fleet Service

Fleet is a Go-based service for managing a fleet of Bitcoin mining devices. It provides gRPC/HTTP API endpoints for device discovery, pairing, telemetry, command execution, and fleet management. It uses PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for persistence and supports multiple miner types (Proto, Antminer, etc.) through a plugin-based architecture.

## Development Commands

### Build and Run

```bash
just dev              # Run local server with Docker Compose (watch mode)
just start            # Start all services (without watch)
just stop             # Stop services
just build            # Build all Go packages
just install          # Install fleetd binary
just rebuild-all      # Clean rebuild (wipes all data, rebuilds plugins)
just rebuild-services # Clean rebuild of docker services only (reuses existing plugin binaries)
just rebuild-fleet-api  # Rebuild just fleet-api
```

From the repo root, `just rebuild-plugin <name>` rebuilds a single plugin (`proto`, `antminer`, `virtual`, or `asicrs`) without touching the others.

### Delve debugging

`fleet-api` runs under `dlv` and exposes it on `:40000` inside the container. By default the dev image builds with Go's usual optimizations and inlining, which makes breakpoints land unreliably (some lines get folded into their callers, locals get optimized away). For reliable breakpoints, opt into a debug build by disabling optimizations and inlining:

```bash
GO_GCFLAGS="all=-N -l" just dev
```

Attach from the host with `dlv connect` or your IDE. Requires mapping port 40000 in `docker-compose.yaml` (not mapped by default).

### Profiling

In `docker-compose.base.yaml`, uncomment `HTTP_PPROF_ADDR` and the matching `ports` entry under `fleet-api` (the port mapping binds to host loopback only), then restart:

```bash
just rebuild-fleet-api
```

Capture profiles while the server is running:

```bash
# CPU (30s sample) — open interactive flame graph in browser
curl "http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30" > cpu.pprof
go tool pprof -http=:8000 cpu.pprof

# Heap allocations
curl http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > heap.pprof
go tool pprof -http=:8000 heap.pprof

# Goroutine trace — shows GC pauses, scheduler latency, I/O stalls
curl "http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5" > trace.out
go tool trace trace.out

# Live goroutine dump (useful for detecting leaks or deadlocks)
curl "http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2"
```

> **Note:** pprof exposes sensitive runtime data. Only bind to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) unless you intentionally want remote access. Never enable in production.

### Testing and Quality

```bash
just test             # Run all tests
just lint             # Lint code
just format           # Format code
```

To run tests for a specific package:

```bash
go test ./internal/domain/pairing -v
go test ./internal/domain/pairing -v -run TestFunctionName
```

### Code Generation

```bash
just gen              # Run all code generation
just gen-db-queries   # Generate database query bindings (sqlc)
just gen-sdk-protos   # Generate SDK protobuf code
just gen-go           # Run go:generate directives
```

All generated code must be checked into Git. Run `just gen` after modifying protobuf definitions, database migrations, or sqlc queries.

### Database Operations

```bash
just db-up            # Start PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB
just db-migrate       # Run migrations
just db-migration-new <name>  # Create new migration
just db-shell         # Interactive PostgreSQL shell
just db-down          # Stop database
just db-reset         # Run down migrations
```

Migrations are sequential and run automatically on startup. **Never modify existing migrations after they have been deployed.**

## Architecture

### Project Structure

The codebase follows a domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns:

- **`cmd/fleetd/`** — Main application entry point and configuration
- **`internal/domain/`** — Core business logic organized by domain (auth, pairing, telemetry, command, etc.)
- **`internal/handlers/`** — gRPC/HTTP request handlers that delegate to domain services
- **`internal/infrastructure/`** — Infrastructure concerns (database, queue, encryption, logging, networking)
- **`generated/`** — All generated code (protobuf, sqlc bindings)
- **`migrations/`** — Database schema migrations (sequential numbered files)
- **`sqlc/queries/`** — SQL query definitions for sqlc code generation
- **`sdk/v1/`** — SDK for external plugin integrations
- **`fake-antminer/`** — Development simulator for testing Antminer plugin integration

### Core Domains

- **Pairing**: Device discovery and registration. Supports multiple miner types through a pluggable pairer interface.
- **Telemetry**: Real-time and historical metrics collection. Uses TimescaleDB and a scheduler for periodic data collection.
- **Commands**: Asynchronous command execution with a database-backed message queue.
- **Fleet Management**: High-level operations for managing groups of devices (listing, filtering, monitoring status).
- **Authentication**: Token-based auth with separate token types for clients (users) and miners (devices).

### Plugin System

Plugins are external processes that communicate with the fleet service:

- **Discovery**: Plugins implement custom device discovery logic for new miner types
- **Pairing**: Plugins implement custom pairing logic for new miner types
- **Priority**: Plugin-based discoverers and pairers take priority over internal implementations

Configuration is in `cmd/fleetd/config.go` with options for plugin directories, startup timeouts, and health check behavior.

### Data Layer

- **PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB**: Primary data store with schema defined in `migrations/`. Migrations run automatically on startup.
- **sqlc**: Type-safe Go code generated from SQL queries in `sqlc/queries/`. Regenerate with `just gen-db-queries` from the server directory.
- **Stores**: Repository pattern implementations in `internal/domain/stores/sqlstores/`.
- **Transactions**: Transactor pattern (`sqlstores.NewSQLTransactor`) for managing transactions across multiple operations.

### API Layer

- **Protocol**: [Connect RPC](https://connectrpc.com/) supporting both gRPC and Connect protocols over HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
- **Interceptors**: Authentication, error mapping, logging, and validation in `internal/handlers/interceptors/`.
- **Proto definitions**: API definitions in `../proto/`. Miner API definitions vendored in `../proto-rig-api/grpc/`.

## Running via Docker

The service runs in Docker with host networking mode. On non-Linux systems, enable host networking in Docker Desktop: **Settings → Resources → Network → Enable host networking**.

```bash
just dev
```

This will:

1. Connect to the database
2. Run any pending migrations
3. Start the server in Docker Compose with watch enabled
4. Serve the API on http://localhost:4000

### Test Simulators

Docker Compose includes simulated miners for development:

- **fake-proto-rig**: Proto firmware simulator (30 replicas by default for temporary cohort/reservation testing; override with `FAKE_PROTO_RIG_REPLICAS`)
- **fake-antminer**: Antminer simulator (2 replicas by default)
- **proto-sim**: Single Proto simulator on fixed ports
- **antminer-sim**: Single Antminer simulator on fixed ports

Scale replicas with: `FAKE_PROTO_RIG_REPLICAS=10 docker compose up fake-proto-rig` or `docker compose up --scale fake-proto-rig=10`

## Configuration

The service is configured using environment variables or command-line flags. See `internal/domain/config.go`. For local development, create a `.env` file in this directory.

At startup, `fleetd` also loads `/etc/fleetd/config.yaml` if that file exists. The YAML file can use nested groups that mirror the config sections, for example:

```yaml
auth:
  client:
    secret-key: "replace-me"
    expiration-period: "1h"
  miner-token-expiration-period: "30m"
encrypt:
  service-master-key: "replace-me"
http:
  address: "0.0.0.0:4000"
```

Command-line flags override values from the YAML file.

## API Testing

## Error Query Service (Testing/Development Only)

The Error Query Service provides a mock error management system for testing. It can return controlled seed data or randomly generated errors for devices.

> **Note:** This is temporary scaffolding to enable client development while server-side error query logic is being implemented.

### Seed Data Configuration

```bash
# Via environment variable
ERROR_QUERY_TEST_ERROR_SEED_FILE=./seed_errors.yaml fleetd
```

**Docker Compose:** In `server/docker-compose.yaml`, uncomment the seed file lines:
```yaml
environment:
  ERROR_QUERY_TEST_ERROR_SEED_FILE: "/app/testdata/seed_errors.yaml"
volumes:
  - ./internal/domain/errorquery/testdata:/app/testdata:ro
```

**Behavior:**
- Devices listed in the seed file use **only** the errors defined in the file
- Devices **not** in the seed file get randomly generated errors (30% probability per device)
- To force a device to have no errors, include it with an empty errors list: `errors: []`

### Seed File Format

```yaml
devices:
  - device_id: 1
    device_type: proto
    errors:
      - canonical_error: HASHBOARD_OVER_TEMPERATURE
        severity: major
        first_seen_ago: 2h
        last_seen_ago: 5m

  - device_id: 2
    device_type: proto
    errors: []  # Healthy device with no errors
```
